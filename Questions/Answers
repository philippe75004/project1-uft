**Question**: What is the most difficult networking bug you've ever faced, and how did you resolve it?

  - Note: This question is a bit different from the one before. For instance, there is no explicit problem to restate. Fortunately, the same response structure will still work, with a few small tweaks.


1. **Restate the Problem** 

   - This question does not pose a specific problem for you to explore. Instead, it requires that you select and explore one of your own debugging experiences. 

2. **Provide a Concrete Example Scenario**

   Select a debugging experience and explain the problem that you had to debug. Do this by answering the following questions:

   - In which part of the project did you encounter the most annoying bug? Consider the following high-level tasks:

     - Creating Azure VM deployments.
     - Configuring VMs with Ansible.
     - Installing and Running ELK with Docker.
     - Implementing access controls.


    - What were you trying to implement when you encountered this bug? If applicable, what error message did you get? For example: installing Docker, deploying infrastructure.
    
    - What did you expect to happen? What would have happened if everything went well?
    
    - What actually happened? What went wrong that you didn't expect?


    - Based on the above error output, how did you determine your first debugging steps?
    
    - What did you discover as you performed your debugging steps?
    
    - Which technique was successful?


3. **Solution Requirements and Details**

   - In addition to explaining which debugging step was successful, elaborate on the following:
   
     - How did you ultimately implement the solution so that you could move on?
   
     - How did you verify that your solution worked?
   
     - Based on your solution, what was broken in the first place?
   
     - Why did your solution work?


4. **Explain Advantages and Disadvantages**

   - Finally, consider the following:

     - Why was this a good solution for the circumstances?

     - Does the same solution work for larger projects? Why or why not?

     - If a different solution is necessary, what would you use instead?
